Welcome to my blog! This is a sample post to demonstrate the blog functionality.

## Why a Blog?

After years of working in DevOps and platform engineering, I've accumulated thoughts on tooling, infrastructure patterns, and the ever-evolving cloud ecosystem. This space is for sharing those learnings.

## What to Expect

Topics I'm likely to cover:

- **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform, OpenTofu, Pulumi patterns
- **Kubernetes** - From cluster operations to developer experience
- **Platform Engineering** - Building internal developer platforms
- **Homelab** - Self-hosting experiments and automation

## The Stack

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), deployed via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages. Simple, fast, and version-controlled.

Here's a taste of what you might see in future posts:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
